Key Features:
Historical Data Visualization: Users can select one or more baby names to see their popularity trends plotted over a 100-year period, helping to understand naming trends over time.

Interactive Plotting: The application uses Matplotlib to create dynamic plots that display the rankings of selected names, making the data visually accessible and easy to interpret.

Users are prompted to input the names they wish to visualize.
The application filters the dataset to select only the requested names and prepares the data for plotting.
The application utilizes Matplotlib to create a visual representation of the selected names' popularity, showing changes in rankings across decades.
